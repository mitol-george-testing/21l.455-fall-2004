Roman Officials and their Duties
--------------------------------

### Consul

As a safeguard against despotism, the former administrative duties of the king-the conduct of military campaigns, the management of public finance, and the control of legislation-were distributed at the beginning of each year between two men, usually elected by the Senate from the patrician class, who served on an annual, rotating basis. In time of emergency, one of the consuls might be named "_Dictator_" with unlimited powers (known as "_imperium_") and no accountability either to the Senate or the People.

### Proconsul

In the year following his term of consulship, the proconsul held imperial authority outside of Rome in whichever province he was assigned to govern.

### Tribunus

To counter-balance the consular powers of the Patricians, the Plebians created the office of tribune, elected by the popular assembly from among the tribes to protect the people from perceived abuses of authority by the Senate and the consuls. Tribunes enjoyed sancrosanct status and were personally above the law.

### Praetor

The local official responsible for administering justice and arbitrating disputes was called _praetor urbanus_ when he was assigned in Rome and _praetor peregrinus_ when outside of Rome.

### Censor

An office of high rank, entrusted only to men who had previously served as consuls, the censorship encompassed financial and accounting responsibilities related to taxation and population management.

### Quaestor

The quaestor served in the ministry of finance.

### Aedile

The curial aedile was responsible for local police protection, the oversight of public markets, the production of theatrical performances, and for the care and upkeep of the temples.

### Magistrate

The title of "magistrate" referred generally to any public official, who served on an annual basis, from the consul all the way down to the position of quaestor. The magistracy was usually considered a necessary precondition for entry into the Roman Senate.

Classifications of Roman Society
--------------------------------

### Senatus

The legislative body, composed of the highest ranking members of Roman society, passed laws, elected consuls, and oversaw the operations of public administration. Usually the Senate was limited to 300 members, but at various times, dictators were able to swell the numbers up to 600 with their personal supporters.

### Tribus

The Roman populace was divided, for the purpose of taxation and public administration, into hereditary _tribus_ or tribes according to residential district, 4 tribes being drawn from locations within the city, 17 from the outlying areas.

### Comitia Centuriata

The Assembly of the Centuries organized the Roman populace for military purposes into groups of 100 fighting-men (called "_centuriae_") in each of 5 different categories (called "_classes_") for a total of 193 centuries altogether: 18 equestrian centuries, 80 heavy infantry, 90 light infantry, 4 artisans and musicians, and 1 of unpropertied soldiers. Half of the centuries consisted of men up to the age of 46 who fought in the field while the other half was composed of men between 47 and 60 who remained behind to defend the City.

### Patrician

The established nobility consisted of a select number of old Roman families, most of whose ancestors had held consular authority in former times. The majority of Senators continued to be Patricians.

### Plebeian

Anyone who was not a member of the Patrician class, including many of the recent nobility, the wealthy and the influential, was considered to be a commoner.

### Freeman

Any person who had been freed from slavery or whose family had been freed from slavery was permitted to participate in public life.
